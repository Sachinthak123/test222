            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher
                absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly
                in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognized and unrecognized schools. Government
                'recognition' is an official stamp of approval and for this, a private school is required to fulfill a
                number of conditions, though hardly any private schools that get 'recognition' actually fulfill all the
                conditions of recognition.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">However, this drop in fertility rates is not immediate. The lag between
                produces a generational population bulge that surges through society. For a period of time this “bulge”
                is a burden on society and increases the dependency ratio. Eventually this group begins to enter the
                productive labor force. With fertility rates continuing to fall and older generations having longer life
                expectancies, the dependency ratio declines dramatically.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> education policies and implementation were determined legally by each
                of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a
                'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal responsibility
                for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and
                eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the policies,
                plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast.</p>
